# Header
OpenSpace provides a socket API for controling and querying the software from other applications.  To use the API, open a local socket connection at port 8000.  To date, there is no full reference of this API, but there is an example here:  https://gist.github.com/emiax/b7a8f9058eb871bc033079e00c13e3b1

The API have changed since the Gist was published.  A more complete javascript example will be released later.
