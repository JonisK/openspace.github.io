## Rotation
 - Use the left mouse button and drag to rotate or orbit around your target.
 - The camera will rotate in the direction you drag.
 - How far you drag the mouse will be how fast the camera will move.

## Zoom
 - Use the right mouse button and drag to zoom closer to or further away from your target.
 - Dragging down will zoom away, dragging up will zoom closer.
 - How far you drag the mouse will be how fast the camera will move.

## Roll (also Yaw and Pitch)
 - Using the CTRL key while dragging with the left mouse button lets you yaw or pitch the camera.
 - Using the middle mouse button (depressing the scroll wheel) lets you roll the camera.
 - Rolling the camera can also be done using the SHIFT key and the left mouse button.

## Friction
 - By default, friction is enabled when controling the camera, slowing the camera to a stop after you move it.
 - Friction can be toggled independantly for Rotation, Zoom or Roll.
 - Clicking the words in the upper right dashbord to toggle the type of friction you want to change.
 - You can also toggle the types of friction using the 'F', 'Shift+F' or 'Ctrl+F' keybinds
