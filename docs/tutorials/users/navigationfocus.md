# Navigation - Focus
{: .no_toc }

This section will cover how to change your focus using the menus so that you can leave the Earth.

## Orbital Navigation and Focus
 - When flying, OpenSpace is always focused on an object in the scene.
 - In order to go to another place, you must change which object you are focused on.
 - To change your object of focus use the focus menu, located at the bottom of your screen between the settings and time menus.

## Retargeting
 - Open the focus menu by clicking. Select your focus from the list or type to search.
 - When you select your new object of focus, the camera will move to look at your new target.
 - The amount of time taken to change the focus can be adusted in the settings under Settings -> Orbital Navigator -> "Retarget interpolation time." The higher the number, the longer it will take to switch between targets.
 - After choosing a new target, you will then have to fly to it, by [zooming in](/docs/tutorials/users/navigationcamera.html#zoom).

## Many Items Will Focus You on the Sun
 - Since focusing on an item will always focus on its center, focusing on many items will appear to target the sun.
 - This is because an items like "HII Regions" or "Jupiter Trail" are datasets based around the sun.
 - For these types of items, there is no point in focusing on them, instead target 'Orion Nebula'
 or 'Jupiter.'
 - To target an individual item from a dataset, you must first create a bookmark for it. Stay tuned for the [Customizing - Bookmarks](docs/tutorials/users/customizingbookmarks) tutorial.

## Leaving the Solar System
 - As you have just learned, most of the datasets are based around the Sun. To leave the Solar System, you just have to zoom away from your current target.
 - OpenSpace only provides two items to focus on that are outside the Solar System: "Orion Nebula" and "Milkyway Volume"
