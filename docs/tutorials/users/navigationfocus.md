## Orbital Navigation and Focus
 - When flying, OpenSpace is always focused on an object in the scene.
 - In order to visit another place, you must change which object you are focused on.
 - To change your object of focus use the focus menu (located in between the settings and time menus).

## Retargeting
 - When changing your object of focus the camera will move to look at your new target.
 - The amount of time taken to change the focus can be adusted in the settings under Settings->Orbital Navigator->"Retarget interpolation time"
 - After choosing a new target, you will then have to fly to it, by [zooming in](/docs/tutorials/users/navigationcamera.html#zoom).

## Many Items Will Focus You on the Sun
 - Since focusing on an item will always focus on it's center, focusing on many items will appear to target the sun.
 - This is because an items like "HII Regions" or "Jupiter Trail" are datasets based around the sun.
 - For these types of items there is no point in focusing on them, instead target 'Orion Nebula'
 or 'Jupiter'
 - To target and individual item from a data set, you must first create bookmark for it. See [Customizing - Bookmmarks](docs/tutorials/users/customizingbookmarks) for a tutorial on how.

## Leaving the Solar System
 - As you have just learned that most of the data sets are based around the sun, to leave the Solar System, you just have to zoom away from your current target.
 - OpenSpace only provides two items to focus on that are outside the Solar System: "Orion Nebula" and "Milkyway Volume"
