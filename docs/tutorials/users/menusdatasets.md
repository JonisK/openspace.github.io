# Using the Menus - Datasets
{: .no_toc }

This section will cover using the menus to turn on and off data, or manipulate sets.

## Finding Datasets
 - All datasets in OpenSpace can be found in the Scene menu.
 - You can search for datasets, or browse for them in the menus.
 - Somethings you find will not be datasets, all datasets will show a checkbox next to their name.
 - Some items with checkboxes many traditionally be considered a dataset, such as a 3D model, or a planet.

## Enabling and Disabling Datasets
 - Use the checkbox next to the datasets name in the menu to turn it on or off.
 - Sometimes you will have to enable or disable multiple items for the effect you want. For example, if you don't want to see mars, you must also turn off it's atmosphere.
 - Some datasets have sizing or fading applied to them based on distances, so they may not appear even if they are enabled. The 'Tully Galaxies' or 'Earth Label' are examples of this. 

## Manipulating Datasets
 - For most datasets you can change aspects of how they are visualized in OpenSpace.
 - Changes can be made by opening the item's submenu by clicking on the item's title.
 - You can also use the wrench icon to popout a panel for the item's properties.
 - Examples include changing the color, or opacity of items. Changing the size of text, changing the width or lengh of trails, etc.
 - Changes made are not saved between OpenSpace sessions. To learn how to save your changes, see: [Customizing OpenSpace - Profiles](/docs/tutorials/users/customizingprofiles)
