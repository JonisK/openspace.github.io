The below assumes your use of OpenSpace with a computer, keyboard, and mouse or trackpad.

## Navigation menu
The Navigation menu in the lower left corner of your screen consists of **Focus, Anchor, and Aim,** which you can use to change the object in focus.  This allows you to set your destination which you can then fly to with Zoom. You can also use these options to set up your view.

Click on Navigation to open the menu.  This will bring up options for your Focus, Anchor, and Aim which you can select by clicking on the object name.  More options can be accessed with the gray "More" button or by using the search bar, which you click to type into.

## Focus
The object in Focus will be at the center of your movement and view.  Click on the crosshair icon to select your focus.

## Anchor and Aim
Anchor and Aim are used together. Anchor locks you onto one object, while Aim will direct your view at another object.  By selecting an object to Aim at, you will remain locked on your Anchored object while looking at the Aimed object, keeping them both in view.  This presents a view that shows the objects in relation to each other, often for dramatic results.

In the Navigation menu, select the anchor icon and telescope icon to choose the objects to Anchor and Aim.

## Moving with your mouse or trackpad
Rotate - hold the left mouse/trackpad button + move the cursor

Zoom - hold the right mouse/trackpad button + move the cursor up or down

Pan - hold control + hold the left mouse/trackpad button + move the cursor

Roll - If you have a middle mouse button, hold middle mouse/trackpad button + move the cursor.  If you do not have a middle mouse button, hold shift + hold the left mouse/trackpad button + move the cursor.
